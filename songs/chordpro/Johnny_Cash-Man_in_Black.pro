{start_of_verse}
[G]Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my [A]back?
And [C]why does my [G]appearance
Seem to [C]have a sombre [G]tone?
Well, there's [A]a reason
for the things that I have [D7]on.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of [A]town
And [C]wear it for the [G]prisoner
Who has [C]long paid for his [G]crime
But is there [A]because
he's a victim of the [D7]times.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]I wear the black for those, who've never read
Or listened to the words, that Jesus [A]said
A[C]bout the road to [G]happiness,
through [C]love and chari[G]ty
Why, you'd [A]think
He's talking straight to you and [D7]me.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak-of-lightnin' cars and fancy [A]clothes
But just [C]so we're re[G]minded of,
the [C]ones who are held [G]back
Up front there [A]oughta be
a man in [D7]black.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones, whose bad trip left them [A]cold
I [C]wear the black in [G]mournin',
for the [C]lives that could have [G]been
Each week we [A]lose
a hundred fine young [D7]men.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their [A]side
I [C]wear it for a[G]nother
hundred [C]thousand who have [G]died
Believin' that [A]we all
were on their [D7]side.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Well, there's things that never will be right, I know
And things need changin' ev'rywhere you [A]go
But 'til we [C]start to make a [G]move,
to [C]make a few things [G]right
You'll never [A]see me
wear a suit of [D7]white.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Aw! I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that ev'rything's [A]OK
But I'll [C]try to carry [G]off
a little [C]darkness on my [G]back
'Til things are [A]brighter
[D7]I'm the man in [G]black.
