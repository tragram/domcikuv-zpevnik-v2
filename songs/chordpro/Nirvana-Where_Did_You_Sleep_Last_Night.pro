[E5]My girl, my girl, don'[A]t lie [G]to me
Tell me [H]where did you [H/F#]sleep last [E5]night
[E5]In the pines, in the pines,
where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [H]shiver the [H/F#]whole night [E5]through

[E5]My girl, my girl, where [A]will you [G]go
I'm [H]going where the [H/F#]cold wind [E5]blows
[E5]In the pines, in the pines,
where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [H]shiver the [H/F#]whole night [E5]through

But his [H]body [H/F#]never was [E5]found
