{start_of_verse}
We [Em]clawed, we chained our [G]hearts in vain
We [D]jumped, never asking [C]why
We [Em]kissed, I fell [G]under your spell
A [D]love no one could [C]deny
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Prechorus}
[C]Don't you ever say [Em]I just walked away
[G]I will always want [C]you
[C]I can't live a lie, [Em]running for my life
[G]I will always want [C]you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
I came in like a [G]wrecking ball[D]
I never hit so [Em]hard in love [C]
All I wanted was to [G]break your walls [D]
All you ever did was [Em]wreck [C]me
Yeah, you [Em]wreck [C]me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I [Em]put you high up in the [G]sky
And [D]now, you're not coming [C]down
It [Em]slowly turned, you let me [G]burn
And [D]now, we're ashes on the [C]ground

[C]I never meant to start a [Em]war
I just wanted you to let [G]me in
And instead of usin[Hm]g force
I guess I should've let [C]you in
I never meant to start [Em]a war
I just wanted you to let [G]me in
I guess I should've let [Hm]you in
[C]Don't you ever say [Em]I just walked away
[G]I will always want [C]you
