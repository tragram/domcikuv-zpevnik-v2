Your be[Dm]auty is be[F]yond compare
With fl[C]aming locks of au[Dm]burn hair
With iv[C]ory skin and e[Am]yes of emerald g[Dm]reen
Your sm[Dm]ile is like a [F]breath of spring
Your vo[C]ice is soft like su[Dm]mmer rain
And I [C]cannot comp[Am]ete with you, J[Dm]olene

He t[Dm]alks about you [F]in his sleep
There[C]'s nothing I can [Dm]do to keep
From cr[C]ying when he c[Am]alls your name, J[Dm]olene
And [Dm]I can easily[F]understand
How [C]you could easily t[Dm]ake my man
But you[C]don't know what he m[Am]eans to me, J[Dm]olene
