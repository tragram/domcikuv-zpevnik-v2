{start_of_verse}
[G]As you go through life you'll [Em]see
there is so much that [C]we don't unders[G]tand.
[G]And the only thing we [Em]know
is things don't always [C]go the way we [G]planned.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: Pre}
But you'll [G]see every [Am]day
that we'll [F]never turn [C]away,
when it [Em]seems all your [C]dreams come [D]undone.

We will [G]stand by your [Am]side,
filled with [F]hope and filled with [C]pride,
we are [Em]more than we [D]are, we are [G]one.
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
[G][C]We are [D]one. [G][C]We are [D]one.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[G]If there's so much I must [Em]be
Can I still just be [C]me, the way I [G]am?
[G]Can I trust in my own h[Em]eart
Or am I just one [C]part, of some big [G]plan?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: Pre}
Even [G]those who are [Am]gone
are with [F]us as we go [C]on,
your jo[Em]urney has [C]only be[D]gun.

Tears of [G]pain, tears of [Am]joy,
one thing not[F]hing can des[C]troy
is our p[Em]ride, deep in[D]side, we are [G]one.
{end_of_bridge}

{chorus}

{start_of_bridge: Pre}
We are [G]one, you and [Am]I,
we are [F]like the earth and [C]sky,
one f[Em]amily [C]under the [D]sun.

All the [G]wisdom to [Am]lead,
all the co[F]urage that you [C]need,
you will f[Em]ind when you [D]see, we are [G]one.
