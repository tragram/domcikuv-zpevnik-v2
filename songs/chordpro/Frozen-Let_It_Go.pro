{start_of_verse}
The [Em]snow glows white on the [C]mountain tonight
Not a [D]footprint to be [Asus4]seen[Am]
A [Em]kingdom of iso[C]lation
And it [D]looks like I'm the [Asus4]queen[A]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[Em]The wind is [C]howling like this
[D]swirling storm ins[Asus4]ide[Am]
[Em]Couldn't keep it [D]in, heaven knows I've[A]tried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Pre}
[D]Don't let them in, don't let them [C]see
Be the good girl you always have to [D]be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them [C]know
Well, now they [Cadd9]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
Can't [Em7]hold it back any[Cadd9]more
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
Turn a[Em7]way and slam the [Cadd9]door
[G]I don't [D/F#]care what they're [Em7]going to [Cadd9]say
[Cadd9]Let the [Bm7]storm rage o[Bb]n
The [C]cold never bothered me anyway
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[Em]It's funny how some [C]distance 
makes [D]everything seem [Am]small
And the [Em]fears that once con[D]trolled me 
can't [Asus4]get to me at [A]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Pre}
[D]It's time to see what I can [C]do
To test the limits and break [D]through
No right, no wrong, no rules for [C]me
I'm [Cadd9]free
{end_of_verse}


{start_of_chorus}
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
I am [Em7]one with the wind and [Cadd9]sky
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
You'll [Em7]never see me [Cadd9]cry
[G]Here I [D/F#]stand and [Em7]here I'll [Cadd9]stay
[Cadd9]Let the [Bm7]storm rage [Bb]on[C]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[C]My power flurries through the air into the ground
[C]My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
[D]And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
[Em]I'm never [C]going back, the [D]past is in the [Am]past[C]
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
And I'll [Em7]rise like the break of [Cadd9]dawn
Let it [G]go, let it [D/F#]go
That [Em7]perfect girl is [Cadd9]gone
[G]Here I [D/F#]stand in the[Em7]light of [Cadd9]day
[Cm]Let the [Bm7]storm rage o[Bb]n
The [C]cold never bothered me anyway
