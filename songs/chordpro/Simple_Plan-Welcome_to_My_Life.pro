{start_of_verse}
Do you [C]ever feel like breaking down?
Do you [Ami]ever feel out of place,
Like som[F]ehow you just don't belong
And [G]no one understands you?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Do you [C]ever wanna run away?
Do you [Ami]lock yourself in your room
With the [F]radio on turned up so loud
That [G]no one hears you're screaming?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge}
No, you [F]don't know what it's like
When [Ami]nothing feels all right
You [F]don't know what it's like
To be like [G]me
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
To be [Ami]hurt, To feel [F]lost
To be [C]left out in the [G]dark
To be [Ami]kicked when you're [F]down
To [C]feel like you've been pushed a[G]round
To be [Ami]on the edge of [F]breaking down
And [C]no one's there to [G]save you
No, you [Dm]don't know what it's like
[F]Welcome to my [C]life
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Do you [C]wanna be somebody else?
Are you [Ami]sick of feeling so left out?
Are you [F]desperate to find something more
Before your [G]life is over?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Do you [C]stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you [Ami]sick of everyone around?
With their [F]big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep in[G]side you're bleeding
{end_of_verse}

{bridge}

{chorus}
{start_of_bridge}
[F]No one ever lied straight to your face
And [Ami]no one ever stabbed you in the back
[F]You might think I'm happy
but I'm [C]not gonna be [G]okay
[F]Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You [Ami]never had to work it was always there
You [F]don't know what it's like, what it's [G]like
