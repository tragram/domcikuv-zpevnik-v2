[Am]I was scared of [G]dentists and the [C]dark
[Am]I was scared of [G]pretty girls
and [C]starting conversations
[Am]Oh, all my friends [G]are turning [C]green
[Am]You're the magician's [G]assistant in their [C]dream

[Am]Ooh, [G]ooh and they [C]come unstuck

Lad[Am]y, run[G]ning down to the rip[C]tide,
taken away to the [Am]dark side,
[G]I wanna be your [C]left hand man
[Am]I love you [G]when you're singing that [C]song
And I got a lump in my [Ami]throat,
'Cause [G]you're gonna sing the [C]words wrong
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[Am]There's this movie that [G]I think you'll [C]like
[Am]This guy decides to [G]quit his job
and [C]heads to New York City
[Am]This cowboy's [G]running from him[C]self
[Am]And she's been living [G]on the highest [C]shelf

[Am]I just wanna, I just wanna [G]know
[C]If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
[Am]I just gotta, I just gotta [G]know
[C]I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
[Am]I swear she's [G]destined for the [C]screen
[Am]Closest thing to [G]Michelle Pfeiffer
[C]that you've ever seen, oh
