{start_of_verse}
Can anybody [Emi]hear me?
Am I [C]talking to my[D]self?
My mind is running empty
In the search for someone else
who doesn't look right through me.
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody [C]tell me [Emi]why
I'm lonely like a [Ami]satel[D]lite?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: R1}
[Emi]Cause tonight
I'm feeling like an [C]astronaut
Sending [Ami]SOS from this [D]tiny box
[Emi]And I lost all signal
when I [C]lifted up
Now I'm [Ami]stuck out here
and the [D]world forgot
[Emi]Can I [C]please come [D]down,
cause I'm [Emi]tired of drifting
[C]round and [D]round
Can I [Emi]please [D]come [C]down?
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Emi]deaf from all the silence
Is it [C]something that I've [D]done?
My mind is running empty
In the search for someone else
who's so disconnected
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody [C]tell me [Emi]why
I'm lonely like a [Ami]satel[D]lite?
{end_of_verse}

{chorus: R1}

{start_of_bridge}
Now I [D]lie awake and scream
in a [C]zero gravity
And it's [D]starting to weigh down on [C]me.
Let's a[D]bort this mission now
Can I [Emi]please [D]come [C]down?
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus: R2}
[Emi]So tonight I'm calling all [C]astronauts
Calling [Ami]lonely people that the [D]world forgot
[Emi]If you hear my voice come [C]pick me up
Are you [Ami]out there?
Cause you're [D]all I've got!
