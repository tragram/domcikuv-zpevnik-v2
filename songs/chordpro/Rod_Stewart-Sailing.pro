[C]I am sailing, I am [Ami]sailing
Home [F]again. Cross the [C]sea.
I am [D7]sailing, stormy [Ami]waters,
To be [Dmi]near you to be [C]free. [G7]

[C]I am flying, I am [Ami]flying,
like a [F]bird, cross the [C]sky.
I am [D7]flying, passing [Ami]high clouds
to be [Dmi]with you to be [C]free. [G7]

[C]Can you hear me, can you [Ami]hear me?
Thro' the [F]dark night, far [C]away.
I am [D7]dying, forever [Ami]trying
to be [Dmi]with you who can [C]say. [G7]

[G#maj7]Oh [Cmaj7]Lord.
