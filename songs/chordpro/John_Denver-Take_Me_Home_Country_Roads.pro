{start_of_verse}
[D]Almost heaven [Hmi]West Virginia
[A]Blue Ridge Mountains, [G]Shenandoah [D]river
life is old there [Hmi]older than the trees
[A]younger than the mountains, [G]blowing like a [D]breeze.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Country [D]roads take me [A]home
to the [Hmi]place I [G]belong
West Vir[D]ginia mountain [A]mamma
take me [G]home country [D]roads.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[D]All my memories [Hmi]gather round her,
[A]Miner's lady, [G]stranger to [D]blue water.
Dark and dusty [Hmi]painted on the sky,
[A]misty taste of moonshine [G]teardrops in my [D]eyes.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge}
[Hmi]I hear her [A]voice in the [D]morning hours she calls me
the [G]radio [D]reminds me of my [A]home far away
And [Hmi]driving down the [C]road I get [G]feeling that I [D]should
have been home [A]yesterday, yester[A7]day.
