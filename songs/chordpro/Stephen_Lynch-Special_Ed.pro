{start_of_verse}
[D]When I [Dsus2]was [D]a boy of [Dsus2]ten
I [D]had a [Dsus2]very [D]special [Dsus2]friend
[D]Ed was [Dsus2]kind, with [D]good [Dsus2]intent
[Em]But just a little [A]different
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [D]special [G]Ed
[Emi]his Mama mama [A]dropped him
dropped him [D]on his [G]head
[Emi]Now he's [A]not so [D]bright [G]instead
[Emi]He's a [A]little bit [D]special [Dsus4]
[D]Just a [Dsus4]little [D]bit [Dsus4]special
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[D]We'd play [Dsus2]tag, and [D]he'd get [Dsus2]hurt
I'd [D]play [Dsus2]soldier, [D]he'd eat [Dsus2]dirt
[D]I liked [Dsus2]math, and the [D]spelling [Dsus2]bee
[Em]Ed liked talking to a [A]tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [D]special [G]Ed
[Emi]his Mama mama [A]dropped him
dropped him [D]on his [G]head
[Emi]Now she keeps him [A](where?) [D]in the shed [G]
[Emi]Cause he's a [A]little bit [D]special [Dsus4]
[D]Just a [Dsus4]little [D]bit [Dsus4]special
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[D]I ran [Dsus2]track, hung [D]out in [Dsus2]malls
[D]Ed ran [Dsus2]headfirst [D]into [Dsus2]walls
[D]I had [Dsus2]girly girls, and [D]lots of [Dsus2]clothes
[Em]Ed had names for all his [A]toes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [D]special [G]Ed
[Emi]his Mama mama [A]dropped him
dropped him [D]on his [G]head
[Emi]Now he thinks [A]he's a [D]piece of [G]bread
[Emi]Cause he's a [A]little bit [D]special [Dsus4]
[D]Just a [Dsus4]little [D]bit [Dsus4]special
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[D]I thought [Dsus2]college [D]life was [Dsus2]great
[D]Ed could [Dsus2]count from [D]one to... [Dsus2]two,
[D]I liked [Dsus2]people and the [D]party [Dsus2]scene
[Em]Ed was scared of the vacuum [A]cleaner
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [D]special [G]Ed
[Emi]his Mama mama [A]dropped him
dropped him [D]on his [G]head
[Emi]Now he [A]thinks he can [D]drive his [G]bed
[Emi]cause he's a [A]little bit [D]special [Dsus4]
[D]just a [Dsus4]little [D]bit... [Dsus4]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[F#mi]Then one day [G]talking to special [F#mi]Ed
He grabbed a [G]brick and he swung at my [F#mi]head
And as he [G]laughed at me that's when I [F#mi]knew
That special [G]Ed just made me [A]special [D]too
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_verse}
[D]Now I [Dsus2]laugh as [D]I count [Dsus2]bugs
I [D]give [Dsus2]strangers [D]great big [Dsus2]hugs
[D]Next to [Dsus2]me Ed [D]is [Dsus2]fine
[Em]Yeah he's a f---ing Ein[A]stein
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [D]Special [G]Ed (and me)
[Emi]Now we're [A]not right [D]in the [G]head (you see)
[Emi]Now we're not so (not so) [D]bright instead[G]
[Emi]We're a [A]little bit [D]special
[Emi]Just a [A]little bit [D]special [G]
[Emi]That bastard [A]Ed made me [D]special [G]
[Emi]Just [A]a little bit [G]
Just a little bit ... spe[D]cial
