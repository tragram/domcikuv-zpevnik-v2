{start_of_verse}
I'm [Ami]sitting here in a [Emi]boring room,
it's [Ami]just another rainy sunday [Emi]afternoon
I'm [Ami]wasting my time I got [Emi]nothing to do,
I'm [Ami]hanging around I'm [Emi]waiting for you
But [Dmi]nothing ever [E]happens
and I [Ami]wonder. [Emi][Ami]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Ami]driving around in my [Emi]car,
I'm [Ami]driving too fast I'm driving too [Emi]far
I'd [Ami]like to change my point of [Emi]view,
I [Ami]feel so lonely I'm waiting for [Emi]you
But [Dmi]nothing ever [E]happens
and I [Ami]wonder. [Emi][Ami]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I [C]wonder how I [G]wonder why
[Ami]yesterday you told me
'bout the [Emi]blue blue sky
and [F]all that I can [G]see
is just a yellow [C]lemon-tree. [G7]
I'm [C]turning my head [G]up and down
I'm [Ami]turning turning turning
turning [Emi]turning around
And [F]all that I can [G]see
is just a yellow lemon[C]-tree. [G7]

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Ami]sitting here I miss the [Emi]power,
I'd [Ami]like to go out taking a [Emi]shower
But [Ami]there's a heavy cloud inside my [Emi]head,
I [Ami]feel so tired put myself into [Emi]bed
Where [Dmi]nothing ever [E]happens
and I [Ami]wonder [Emi][Ami]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge}
[E]Isolation - [Ami]is not good for me
[G]Isolation - [C]I don't want to
[E]sit on a lemon-tree
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Ami]steppin' around in a [Emi]desert of joy,
[Ami]baby anyhow I'll get [Emi]another toy
and [Dmi]everything will [Emi]happen
and [Ami]I will wond[Emi]er [Ami]
