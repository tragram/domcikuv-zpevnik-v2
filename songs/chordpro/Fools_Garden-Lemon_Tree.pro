I'm [Ami]sitting here in a [Emi]boring room,
it's [Ami]just another rainy sunday [Emi]afternoon
I'm [Ami]wasting my time I got [Emi]nothing to do,
I'm [Ami]hanging around I'm [Emi]waiting for you
But [Dmi]nothing ever [E]happens
and I [Ami]wonder. [Emi][Ami]

I'm [Ami]driving around in my [Emi]car,
I'm [Ami]driving too fast I'm driving too [Emi]far
I'd [Ami]like to change my point of [Emi]view,
I [Ami]feel so lonely I'm waiting for [Emi]you
But [Dmi]nothing ever [E]happens
and I [Ami]wonder. [Emi][Ami]

'bout the [Emi]blue blue sky
and [F]all that I can [G]see
is just a yellow [C]lemon-tree. [G7]
I'm [C]turning my head [G]up and down
I'm [Ami]turning turning turning
turning [Emi]turning around
And [F]all that I can [G]see
is just a yellow lemon[C]-tree. [G7]
