(Well) [Am]I know the time has numbered my days,
And I'll go along with [F]everything you [C]say
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
But I'll [Am]ride home laughing, look at me now,
For the walls of my tower they come [F]crumbling [C]down
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
And my [Am]ears hear the call of my unborn sons,
And I know the choices [F]color all I've [C]done
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
But I'll [Am]explain it all to the watchman's son,
I ain't ever lived a year [F]better spent in [C]love
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]

'Cause I [Am]know my [G]weakness, [F]know my [C]voice
And [Am]I'll be[G]lieve in [F]grace and [C]choice [G]
And I [Am]know per[G]haps my [F]heart is [C]fast
But [Am]I'll be [G]born [F]without a [C]mask [G]

Like the [Am]city that nurtured my greed and my pride,
I stretched my arms [F]into the [C]sky
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
I cry [Am]Babel, Babel, look at me now
For the walls of my tower they come [F]crumbling [C]down
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
You ask [Am]where will we stand in the winds that will howl
Is all we see we'll [F]slipping to the [C]cloud?
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
So come [Am]down from your mountain and stand where we've been
You know our breath is [F]weak and our body [C]thin
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]
[C][C6/9][C][C6/9][F][C]

[Am]Press my [F]nose up to the [C]glass around your [G]heart
[Am]I should've [F]known I was [C]weaker from the [G]start
[Am]You'll build your [F]walls, and I will [C]play my bloody [G]part
[C]To tear, [F]tear them [C]down
[Am]Well I'm gonna [C]tear, [F]tear them [C]down
