[G]I am a qu[C]estion to the w[G]orld
Not an a[C]nswer to be he[G]ard
Or a mo[C]ment, that's [Am7]held in your ar[C]ms
And w[G]hat, do ya t[C]hink you'd ever s[G]ay?
I won't lis[C]ten an[G]yway
You don't kn[C]ow me
And I'[Em]ll never [D]be what you [C]want me to [G]be[C][G][C]

And w[G]hat, do you th[C]ink you'd understa[G]nd?
I'm a b[C]oy, no, I'm a m[G]an
You can't ta[C]ke me, and t[Am7]hrow me aw[C]ay
And h[G]ow, can you lea[C]rn what's never sh[G]own?
Yeah you s[C]tand here on your ow[G]n
They don't kn[C]ow me,
cause I[Em]'m n[D]ot he[C]re[G][C][G][C]

And [G]I want a [C]moment to be r[G]eal
Wanna t[C]ouch things I don't fe[G]el
Wanna ho[C]ld on, and f[Am7]eel I b[C]elong
And h[G]ow, can the [C]world want me to c[G]hange?
They're the o[C]nes that stay the s[G]ame
They don't k[C]now me, cause[Em]I'm[D]not [C]here
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
And y[G]ou, see the th[C]ings they never se[G]e
All you w[C]anted, I could b[G]e
Now you kn[C]ow me, and I[Am7]'m not afr[C]aid
And [G]I, wanna [C]tell you who I[G]am
Can you h[C]elp me be a m[G]an?
They can't b[C]reak me
As [Em]long as I k[D]now who I [C]am[G][C][G][C]

C[C]uz I'm n[D]ot what they s[Em]ee
