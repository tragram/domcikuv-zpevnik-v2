{start_of_verse}
[G]Cold is the water
It freezes your al[C]ready cold mind
Already cold, [G]cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will [C]steal your innocence
But it will not [G]steal your substance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[D]But you are not [C]alone in [G]this
And [C]you are not [Em]alone in [G]this
As [C]brothers we will [Dadd9]stand and 
we'll [G]hold [G/F#]your [Emi]hand
Hold your [G]hand
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[G]And you are the mother
The mother of your [C]baby child
The one to whom you [G]gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what [C]make man great
His ladder to the [G]stars
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
And [C]I [G]will [Em]tell [C]the [G]night
[C]Whis[G]per, [Em]"Lose [C]your [G]sight"
But [C]I [G]can't [Em]move [C]the [G]moun[C]tains for [G]you
