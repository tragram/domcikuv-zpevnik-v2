{start_of_verse}
Last [D]night I had a [Em]dream
We were in[G]separably en[A]twined
Like a [D]piece of rope [Em]made out of
Two [G]pieces of [A]vine
Held to[D]gether holding [Em]each other
With [G]no one else in [A]mind
Like two [D]atoms in a [Em]molecule
In[G]separably com[A]bined
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
But then I [D]woke from the [Em]dream
To re[G]alise I was a[A]lone
A [D]tragic event I [Em]must admit
But [G]let's not be over[A]blown
I'm not [D]trying to write a [Em]love song
Just a [G]sad pathetic [A]moan
And [D]maybe I just need [Em]change
Maybe I [G]just need a new co[A]logne
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
But now I [D]look at [Em]love
Like being [G]stabbed in the [A]heart
You [D]torture each other [Em]from day to day
And [G]then one day you [A]part
Most of the [D]time it's [Em]misery
But there's [G]some joy at the [A]start
And for [D]that I'd say it's [Em]worth it
Just use a [G]blade that's short and [A]sharp on me
