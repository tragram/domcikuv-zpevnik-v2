I [C]hurt [D]myself [Ami]today
to [C]see if [D]I still [Ami]feel,
I [C]focus [D]on the [Ami]pain,
the [C]only [D]thing that's [Ami]real.

The [C]needle [D]tears a [Ami]hole,
the [C]old [D]familiar [Ami]sting,
try to [C]kill it [D]all [Ami]away,
but I [C]remember [D]everything. [G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[Ami]What have I [F]become,
[C]my sweetest [G]friend?
[Ami]Everyone I [F]know
goes [C]away in the [G]end.

And [Ami]you could have it [F]all,
[G]my empire of [G]dirt,
[Ami]I will let you [F]down,
[G]I will make you [Ami]hurt.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I [C]wear this [D]crown of [Ami]thorns
[C]upon my [D]liar's [Ami]chair,
[C]full of [D]broken [Ami]thoughts
[C]I can[D]not [Ami]repair.

[C]Beneath the [D]stains of [Ami]time
the [C]feelings [D]disappear, [Ami]
[C]you are [D]someone [Ami]else,
[C]I am [D]still right [G]here.

[Ami]I will let you [F]down,
[G]I will make you [G]hurt.

[Ami]If I could start [F]again,
[G]a million miles [G]away,
[Ami]I would keep [F]myself,
[G]I would find a way.
