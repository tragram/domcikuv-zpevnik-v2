I [G]start my day with coffee
or [C]kaffi is what we [G]say
I [Em]pour a little mjólk in
and [D]feed my horse some hey ( hey )
{start_of_verse}

{end_of_verse}
I [G]look out the window
to [C]see if there is [G]sól.
I [Em]eat my morgunmatur
and [D]sit down in my stól.

[D]And vinir you can meet. Skál!

Our [G]sundlaugar are cosy.
Af[C]klæðast all the[G]way.
But [Em]don't forget sundskýla,
[D]Before you go and play. ( OK )
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]You might see a torfbær
Or[C]hike in the þjóð[G]garð
And you [Em]must say hi to Villi
Because[D]that is my dad? Pabbi!
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: Pre}
And you can [C]rent a bíla[G]leigu[D]bíll
Enjoy the [C]drive on hring[G]vegur[D]inn
Be mindful [C]of mal[G]arveg[D]ir
And don't traðka on the[Am]moss -
It grows back so [D]slow!
Like seventy years!

{chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[Em]Since the upphaf alda,
the [C]sheep has been around.
[D]Vinaleg and gracious,
[Am]Every man's best friend.
We[C]cuddle them and klappa
And then take all their ull.
We[D]wear them like the kappar
And they've always kept us… Full!
