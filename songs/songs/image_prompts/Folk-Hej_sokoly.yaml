response: Create an illustration of a young Cossack on horseback, bidding farewell
  to his beloved against a backdrop of the Ukrainian landscape. Include elements like
  rolling hills, green fields, and a distant skyline. Incorporate a soaring falcon
  in the sky and a distant bell ringing, symbolizing longing and connection. The scene
  should evoke a sense of nostalgia and love for homeland.
