response: Create an illustration of a soaring swallow flying over the Great Wall of
  China and the Gobi Desert, with a dreamy night sky filled with stars. Incorporate
  elements of music, like notes or a silhouette of Beethoven, and add whimsical touches
  like fish and flamingos in the clouds, alongside a gentle figure of Mary Magdalene
  blowing on the swallow's feathers. The scene should evoke a sense of adventure and
  hope.
