response: Create an illustration that captures a melancholic yet hopeful scene inspired
  by the song lyrics. Depict a winter landscape with rain falling on gnarled trees,
  while a warm light glows softly in the background. Include silhouettes of migrating
  birds in the sky and a figure with flowing hair, symbolizing lost love and longing,
  surrounded by musical notes. The overall mood should blend sadness with a sense
  of beauty and nostalgia.
