response: Create an illustration of a somber seascape featuring a small white ship
  named "My grave" sailing toward rocky cliffs under a stormy sky. In the foreground,
  depict three white stone crosses arranged in the sand, each representing a troubled
  past. Include a weathered sailor holding a tattered ship's log, with tears in his
  eyes, conveying a sense of loss and reflection. The atmosphere should be melancholic,
  emphasizing themes of regret and redemption.
