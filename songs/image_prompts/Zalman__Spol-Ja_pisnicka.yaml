  response: Create an image of a melancholic woman, embodying the spirit of a song,
    surrounded by shadows of poets and lovers. She is dressed in a wedding gown, with
    a sense of vulnerability, sitting in a dimly lit tavern filled with echoes of
    lost love. Include elements like a rose, a music note, and faint silhouettes of
    strangers on the walls. The atmosphere should be introspective and poignant, capturing
    the essence of longing and the weight of unspoken fears.
