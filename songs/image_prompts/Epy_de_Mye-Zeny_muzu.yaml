  response: Create an illustration that captures the essence of longing and resilience,
    featuring a woman standing in a cozy kitchen, looking out a window with a mix
    of hope and sadness. The scene should convey the contrast between the warmth of
    home and the struggles of the men who venture out, symbolized by distant mountains
    and stormy skies. Include elements that represent both the beauty and challenges
    of their journeys, such as a collection of flowers and a pair of wings in the
    background.
