  response: Create an illustration that captures the darkly humorous and satirical
    essence of the song, featuring a couple in a romantic yet unsettling setting.
    The scene should depict a blend of love and ominous symbols, such as a heart intertwined
    with a swastika, a tattoo of a skull, and a vintage TV showing footage from Nuremberg.
    The background should include military motifs and references to historical figures,
    juxtaposed with romantic elements like flowers and hearts, to reflect the song's
    ironic take on a relationship with troubling undertones.
