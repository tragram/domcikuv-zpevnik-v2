  response: 'Create an illustration that captures the essence of heartbreak and nostalgia.
    Depict a dimly lit, empty apartment filled with remnants of a past relationship:
    an apple-scented foam bottle, a disconnected phone, and a beautifully illustrated
    but meaningless book. The atmosphere should convey a sense of loneliness and reflection,
    with subtle hints of the couple''s memories lingering in the air.'
