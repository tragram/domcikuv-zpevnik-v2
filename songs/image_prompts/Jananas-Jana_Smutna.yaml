  response: Create an illustration that captures the essence of sadness and melancholy
    depicted in the song. Include a lonely puppy under a dark sky, a wounded deer
    lying in the grass, and a desolate landscape with a fading white horse. Incorporate
    elements of disappointment, such as a neglected party scene and an empty chair,
    to reflect the feelings of isolation and sorrow expressed in the lyrics.
