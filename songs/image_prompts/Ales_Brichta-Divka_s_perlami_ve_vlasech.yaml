  response: Create an illustration of a melancholic love scene featuring a woman with
    pearl-studded hair and a sad expression, standing in a dimly lit room with a flickering
    candle. The atmosphere should evoke feelings of loss and longing, with hints of
    a once-grand romance. Include elements that symbolize unfulfilled desires, such
    as a faded crown or a broken heart motif in the background.

  response: Create an illustration of a melancholic scene featuring a woman with a pearl
    headband, standing at a doorway with a faint smile that contrasts with her sad expression.
    Surround her with a soft, dim light, and include subtle hints of tears glistening
    in her eyes. In the background, depict a shadowy figure representing lost love,
    while the atmosphere conveys a sense of longing and heartache, reflecting the themes
    of love, loss, and unfulfilled desires from the song.
