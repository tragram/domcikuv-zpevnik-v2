  response: Create an illustration depicting a melancholic scene of two people separated
    by a week, with a calendar showing the days passing. Include imagery that symbolizes
    longing and silence, such as a pencil lying unused and a clock with its hands
    stuck on the eighth day. The atmosphere should convey a sense of yearning and
    missed connections.
