  response: Create an image of a mystical black horse in a lush garden at dawn, with
    a white strand of hair caught in the breeze. The horse's deep, inviting eyes reflect
    a serene pond. In the background, ethereal figures representing Shakespeare, Mácha,
    and Lord Byron mingle with a water nymph and a girl with horses. The scene is
    infused with a sense of nostalgia and longing, with fallen chestnuts scattered
    on the ground and the scent of rain in the air.

  response: An ethereal scene in a misty garden where a mysterious black horse with
    deep, alluring eyes approaches. Its mane flows as if it holds a dream-like energy,
    representing the poetic and romantic vision of Shakespeare, Byron, and Mácha.
    The environment feels mystical and intimate, reflecting the beauty and melancholy
    of the song.
