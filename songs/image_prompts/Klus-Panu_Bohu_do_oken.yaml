  response: Create an illustration depicting a surreal landscape inspired by the lyrics,
    featuring a whimsical, idyllic countryside with velvet-clad figures engaging in
    absurd activities like fishing for food scraps and listening to music. Include
    elements of political satire, such as billboards with exaggerated faces and a
    backdrop of contrasting poverty and opulence. Capture a sense of disillusionment
    and irony, with dark clouds looming over the vibrant scene.

  response: A satirical depiction of a distant land beyond mountains and rivers, where
    thieves eat stew from plastic plates with golden cards. The scene shows corrupt
    politicians with billboards along the highway, portraying a world of wealth inequality,
    hypocrisy, and cynicism. The imagery captures a biting critique of the political
    system with an atmosphere of despondency.
