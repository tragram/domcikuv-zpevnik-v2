  response: Create an illustration of a nostalgic musician standing by a dusty roadside
    on a Saturday morning, surrounded by old friends. The scene should capture a sense
    of longing and reflection, with a hint of melancholy. Include elements like an
    acoustic guitar, a weathered canvas tent, and a starry night sky transitioning
    into dawn, symbolizing the journey and memories of a wandering artist.
