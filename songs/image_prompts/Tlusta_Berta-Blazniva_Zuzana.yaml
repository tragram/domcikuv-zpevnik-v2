  response: Create an illustration of a whimsical, surreal scene featuring a character
    named Zuzana, who is playfully exploring the world through a barred window. In
    the background, depict a scene with Icarus missing his wings and Copernicus tied
    to a bed, gazing at a star on the ceiling. Include Columbus standing nearby, surrounded
    by a dreamlike landscape of floating ships and flying stars, with a sense of longing
    and connection to the earth. The overall mood should be both fantastical and melancholic,
    capturing the essence of searching for freedom and love.
