  response: Create an illustration depicting the dramatic confrontation between David
    and Goliath. Show David, a young shepherd with a slingshot, confidently facing
    the towering giant Goliath, who is sneering down at him. Surround them with a
    biblical landscape, including hints of ancient armor and stones. Capture the tension
    and courage in David's expression as he prepares to take his shot.
