response: Create an illustration of a melancholic house in New Orleans with a sun
  emblem on its gable. The scene should evoke a sense of longing and despair, featuring

  of the city's atmosphere, such as worn-down streets and hints of vibrant culture,
  contrasted with a feeling of coldness and confinement.
