  response: The song describes a nostalgic summer spent in a remote village at a grandmother's
    house, highlighting the simplicity and isolation of rural life. The narrator longs
    for youthful experiences, running to the beach to sunbathe and play, but finds
    the beach deserted except for an old man. The village lacks modern amenities and
    youth, creating a stark contrast to city life. The narrator reflects on the emptiness
    of the beach and the dirt road leading to it, but looks forward to a village party
    where they hope to meet other young people. The imagery evokes a sense of longing
    for connection and the bittersweet nature of rural solitude.
