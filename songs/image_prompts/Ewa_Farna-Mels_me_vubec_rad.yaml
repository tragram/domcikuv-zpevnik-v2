  response: Create an illustration that captures the emotional turmoil of longing
    and uncertainty in a relationship. Depict a solitary figure standing on a dimly
    lit street, looking up at a starry sky, with a mix of hope and despair in their
    expression. Include elements like fading memories represented by ghostly silhouettes
    in the background and a distant phone glowing, symbolizing the desire for connection.
