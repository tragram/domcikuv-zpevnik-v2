  response: Create an illustration of a lonely city street at sunset, with a distant
    silhouette of a person wandering alone. The scene should evoke feelings of nostalgia
    and melancholy, featuring empty cars and fluttering leaves caught in the wind.

    and scattered papers on the ground, with a few broken piano keys. The atmosphere
    should reflect a sense of loss and longing for a past connection.
