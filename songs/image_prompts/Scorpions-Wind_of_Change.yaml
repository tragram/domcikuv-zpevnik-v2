  response: Create an illustration of a serene summer night in Gorky Park, Moscow,
    with soldiers passing by. The scene should capture a sense of nostalgia and hope,
    featuring children dreaming under a starry sky, symbolizing the "wind of change."
    Include elements of nature like gently blowing trees and a soft breeze to evoke
    a magical atmosphere.
