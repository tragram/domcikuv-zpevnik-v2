   Emi
1. Can anybody hear me?
   C    D
   Am I talking to myself?
   My mind is running empty
   In the search for someone else who doesn't look right through me.
   It's all just static in my head
               Emi                           D
   Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite?

   Emi                               C
R: Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
           D             G
   Sending SOS from this tiny box
   Emi                          C
   And I lost all signal when I lifted up
           D                      G
   Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
   Emi   Emi/C       D               Emi               C         D
   Can I please come down, cause I'm tired of drifting round and round
         Emi    D    C
   Can I please come down?

2. I'm deaf from all the silence
   Is it something that I've done?
   I know that there are millions
   I can't be the only one who's so disconnected
   It's so different in my head.
   Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite?

R: Cause tonight I'm feeling...

   Now I lie awake and scream in a zero gravity
   And it's starting to weigh down on me.
   Let's abort this mission now
   Can I please come down?
   
   So tonight I'm calling all astronauts
   Calling lonely people that the world forgot
   If you hear my voice come pick me up
   Are you out there?
   Cause you're all I've got!
   
R: Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
   Sending SOS from this tiny box
   And I lost all signal when I lifted up
   Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
   
R: Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
   Sending SOS from this tiny box
   To the lonely people that the world forgot
   Are you out there?
   Cause you're all I've got!
   
   Can I please come down?
   Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round.
   Can I please come down?
   
   Can I please come down?
   Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round.
   Can I please come down?
   
   Can I please come down?
   Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round.
   Can I please come down?
