A                         C#mi7
As the snow flies... On a cold and grey Chicago morning
  D                E7                   A
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
        A                       C#mi7
And his mamma cries... 'Cos if there's one thing that she dont need
     D                E7                  A
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto

                 E
People dont you understand
                   D       A
The child needs a helping hand
    D                 E                    A
Or he'll gonna be an angry young man some day
                E
Take a look at you and me
             D       A
Are we too blind to see
    D            C#mi               Bmi           E7
Or do we simply turn our heads and look the other way

Well, the world turns... And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
And his hunger burns... So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto

  E                                D                A
Then one night in desperation the young man breaks away
    D              C#mi7
He buys a gun, he steals a car,
    Bmi                E7
He tries to run but he dont get far

And his mamma cries... As a crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And as her young man dies... On a cold and grey Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto...
