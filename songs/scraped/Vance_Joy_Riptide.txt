1. I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

   Am   G    C    C
B: Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Am   G            C            -
Ooh, ooh and they come unstuck

      Am    G                   C
R: Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
to the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump
in my throat, 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

3. There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

   Am                         G
B: I just wanna, I just wanna know
C                                
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
Am                         G
I just gotta, I just gotta know
C                                    
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
Am            G                C
I swear she's destined for the screen
Am               G                 C
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
