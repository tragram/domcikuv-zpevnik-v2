Capo:1 poloha
Am              G                C   C
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Am   G    C    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Am   G            C            -
Ooh, ooh and they come unstuck

Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
to the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump
in my throat, 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

Am                         G
I just wanna, I just wanna know
C                                
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
Am                         G
I just gotta, I just gotta know
C                                    
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

Am            G                C
I swear she's destined for the screen
Am               G                 C
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
