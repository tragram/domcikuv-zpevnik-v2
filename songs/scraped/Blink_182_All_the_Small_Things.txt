C         G         F         G
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

C, G, F, C
Na, na...

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs,
Surprises, let me know she cares

Say it ain't so,
I will not go,
Turn the lights off,
Carry me home

Na, na...

Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill,

The night will go on, My little windmill

Say it ain't so, I will not go,
                 
Turn the lights off, Carry me home
                        
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill,
              
The night will go on, The night will go on, My little windmill
