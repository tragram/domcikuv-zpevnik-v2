1. Just a perfect day
   C        F
   Drink sangria in the park
   B      Gmi
   Then later when it gets dark
   A
   We go home
   
   Just a perfect day
   Feed animals in the zoo
   Then later a movie too
   And then home

   D       G
R: Oh it's such a perfect day
   F#mi                G
   I'm glad I spent it with you
   D    A
   Such a perfect day
       Hmi      A  G
   You just keep me hanging on
       Hmi      A  G
   You just keep me hanging on
  
2. Just a perfect day
   Problems all left alone
   Weekenders on our own
   It's such fun
   
   Just a perfect day
   You made me forget myself
   I thought I was someone else
   Someone good

R: Oh it's such a perfect day...
