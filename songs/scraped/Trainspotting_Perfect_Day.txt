1. Just a perfect day,
   G              C
   Drink Sangria in the park,
   F                     Dm
   And then later, when it gets dark,
          E
   We go home.

2. Just a perfect day,
   Feed animals in the zoo
   Then later, a movie, too,
   And then home.

   Oh such a perfect day,
                F#m     E      D
   [: You just keep me hanging on. :]

3. Just a perfect day,
   Problems all left alone,
   Weekenders on our own.
   It's such fun.

4. Just a perfect day,
   You made me forget myself.
   I thought I was someone else,
   Someone good.
   
R: Oh it's such a perfect day ...
