1. I don't know you
   F
   But I want you
   C                  F
   All the more for that
   C
   Words fall through me
   F   
   And always fool me
   C             F  
   And I can't react
  
   Ami            G      F
   And games that never amount
    G            Ami
   To more than they're meant
     G              F
   Will play themselves out

    C                F                 Ami
R: Take this sinking boat and point it home
                    F
   We've still got time
    C                 F                Ami
   Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
                   F
   You've made it now

2. Falling slowly,
   F
   eyes that know me
   C               F
   And I can't go back
   C  
   Moods that take me
   F
   and erase me
   C                F
   And I'm painted black

   Ami         G      F
   You have suffered enough
       G            Ami
   And warred with yourself
   G               F
   It's time that you won

    C                F                 Ami
R: Take this sinking boat and point it home
                    F
   We've still got time
    C                 F                Ami
   Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
                   F
   You've made it now

   C              F              Ami
...Falling slowly sing your melo dy
               F
   I'll sing along.......
   C               F             Ami         F
