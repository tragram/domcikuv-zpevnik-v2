         G                 Emi
1. I've heard there was a secret chord
        G                    Emi
   That David played, and it pleased the Lord.
       C                D               G      D
   But you don't really care for music, do you? 
      G                   C           D
   It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
       Emi             C
   The minor fall, the major lift
       D               H7          Emi
   The baffled king composing Hallelujah
        C           Emi
R: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
        C           G    D   G
   Hallelujah, Hallelu-uuuu-ujah
              G                         Emi  
2. Your faith was strong but you needed proof
        G                 Emi
   You saw her bathing on the roof 
       C              D          G           D 
   Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
      G             C           D    
   She tied you To a kitchen chair
      Emi                         C
   She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
       D                  H7        Emi   
   And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
R: Hallelujah .....
3. You say I took the name in vain
   I don't even know the name
   C              D          G           D 
   But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
   There's a blaze of light In every word
   It doesn't matter which you heard
   The holy or the broken Hallelujah
R: Hallelujah .....
     G                 Emi
4. I did my best, it wasn't much
   I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
   I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
   And even though It all went wrong
   I'll stand before the Lord of Song
   With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
