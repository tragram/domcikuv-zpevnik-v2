1. I hurt myself today to see if I still feel,Â¨
     C     D      Ami       C    D            Ami
   I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
       C      D       Ami       C     D      Ami
   The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,
          C       D    Ami          C      D    G
   try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.

R: What have I become, my sweetest friend?
   Ami        F          C          G
   Everyone I know goes away in the end.
       Ami               F    G            G
   And you could have it all, my empire of dirt,
   Ami            F     G               Ami
   I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

2. I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,
   C       D      Ami      C    D     Ami
   full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.

   Beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear,
   C       D       Ami   C    D           G
   you are someone else, I am still right here.

   If I could start again, a million miles away,
   Ami          F       G            
   I would keep myself, I would find a way.
