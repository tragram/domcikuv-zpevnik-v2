  D             Hmi
1. Almost heaven West Virginia
  A                      G          D
   Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah river
                     Hmi
   life is old there older than the trees
   A                           G              D
   younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.

           D             A
R: Country roads take me home
          Hmi       G
   to the place I belong
           D              A
   West Virginia mountain mamma
           G            D
   take me home country roads.

2. All my memories gather round her,
  A              G           D
   Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                  Hmi
   Dark and dusty painted on the sky,
   A                        G               D
   misty taste of moonshine teardrops in my eyes.

R: Country...

   Hmi        A            D
*: I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me
       G       D              A
   the radio reminds me of my home far away
       Hmi              C          G               D
   And driving down the road I get feeling that I should
                  A                A7
   have been home yesterday, yesterday.

                A             D
