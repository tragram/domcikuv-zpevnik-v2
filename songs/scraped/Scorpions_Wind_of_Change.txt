1. I follow the Moscow
                G
   Down to Gorkypark
                    Ami     Emi D
   Listening to the wind of change
      G                 Ami
   On the august summer night
                    G
   soldiers passing by
                    Ami     Emi D
   Listening to the wind of change
   
2. The world is closing in
   Did you ever think
   That we could be so closed like brothers
   The future’s in the air
   Can feel it everywhere
   The blowing with the wind of change
   
   G    D         Ami          D
R: Take me to the magic of the moment
      G       D
   on glory night
            Ami              D
   When the children of tomorrow
         Emi  C            D
   Dream away in a wind of change
   
3. Walking down the street
   And distand memories
   Are buried in the past forever
   Follow the Moscow
   And don’t you go give up
   Listening to the wind of change
   
R: Take me to the magic of the moment
   on glory night
   When the children of tomorrow
   Share the dream with you and me
   
R: Take me to the magic of the moment
   on glory night
   When the children of tomorrow
   Dream away in a wind of change
