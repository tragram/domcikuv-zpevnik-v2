   Home again. Cross the sea.

   I am sailing, stormy waters,
         Dmi            C    G
   To be near you to be free.
   
2. I am flying, I am flying,
   like a bird, cross the sky.
   I am flying, passing high clouds
   to be with you, to be free.
   
3. Can you hear me, can you hear me?
   Thro' the dark night, far away.
   I am dying, forever trying
   to be with you who can say.
