      Em                     G
1. We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
      D                    C
   We jumped, never asking why
      Em             G           
   We kissed, I fell under your spell
     D                  C
   A love no one could deny
   
   C                 Em
P: Don’t you ever say I just walked away
   G                  C
   I will always want you
   C                  Em 
   I can’t live a lie, running for my life
   G                  C
   I will always want you
   
                  G
R: I came in like a wrecking ball
   D              Em
   I never hit so hard in love
   C                  G
   All I wanted was to break your walls
   D                     Em   C
   All you ever did was wreck me
           Em    C
   Yeah, you wreck me
   
2. I put you high up in the sky
   And now, you’re not coming down
   It slowly turned, you let me burn
   And now, we’re ashes on the ground

R: (2x)
   
   C                       Em
   I never meant to start a war
                             G
   I just wanted you to let me in
                      Hm
   And instead of using force
                             C
   I guess I should’ve let you in
                          Em
   I never meant to start a war
                             G
   I just wanted you to let me in
                             Hm
   I guess I should’ve let you in
   
   C                 Em
   Don’t you ever say I just walked away
   G                  C
   I will always want you

   Yeah, you wreck me
