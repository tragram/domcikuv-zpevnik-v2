  Dm       F
I walk a lonely road
    C             G           Dm
The only one that I have ever known   
          F
Don't know where it goes
C                G             Dm
But it's home to me and I walk alone

F C G

Dm          F
I walk this empty street
C          G               Dm
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
         F
When the city sleeps
    C            G                Dm 
And I'm the only one and I walk alone


F C             G             Dm
      I walk alone, I walk alone
F C             G        
      I walk alone, I walk a...

B    F            C             Dm
  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
B    F       C                  Dm
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
B     F       C                Dm
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
B      F      A
  'til then I walk alone     

Dm     F      C      G
 Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
Dm     F      C      G
 Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah

Dm          F
I'm walking down the line
C                  G            Dm
That divides me somewhere in my mind
        F
On the border line
C                 G             Dm
Of the edge and where I walk alone

         F
Read between the lines
C                        G            Dm
What's fucked up and everything's alright
          F
Check my vital signs
C                   G                  Dm 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

F C             G             Dm
   I walk alone, I walk alone
F C             G       
   I walk alone, I walk a...
