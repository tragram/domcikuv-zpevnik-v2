1. I'm sitting here in a boring room,
        Ami                       Emi
   it's just another rainy sunday afternoon
       Ami                   Emi           
   I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do,
        Ami               Emi
   I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
       Dmi            Emi           Ami      Emi   Ami   
   But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
   
2. I'm driving around in my car,
   I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far
   I'd like to change my point of view,
   I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
   But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

R: I wonder how I wonder why yesterday 
                         Emi
   you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
       F              G                    C        G7  
   and all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree.    
       C               G      
   I'm turning my head up and down
       Ami                             Emi
   I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
       F                                        G     G7
   And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree.

3. I'm sitting here I miss the power,
   I'd like to go out taking a shower
   But there's a heavy cloud inside my head,
   I feel so tired put myself into bed
   Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder
   
   E           Ami             
   Isolation - is not good for me
   G           C
   Isolation - I don't want to
   E
   sit on a lemon-tree
   
       Ami                  Emi        
   I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy,
   Ami                  Emi
   baby anyhow I'll get another toy
       Dmi            Emi           Ami        Emi   Ami
   and everything will happen - and I will wonder
