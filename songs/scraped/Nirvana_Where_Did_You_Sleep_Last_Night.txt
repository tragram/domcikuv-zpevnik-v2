            H                        Emi
   Tell me where did you sleep last night
   Emi                                   A              G
   In the pines, in the pines, where the sun don't ever shine
            H                      Emi
   I would shiver the whole night through
    
2. My girl, my girl, where will you go
   I'm going where the cold wind blows
   In the pines, in the pines, where the sun don't ever shine
   I would shiver the whole night through
