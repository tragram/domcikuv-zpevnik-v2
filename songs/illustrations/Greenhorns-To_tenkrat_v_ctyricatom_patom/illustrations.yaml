      Create an illustration of a lively scene in Plzeň, capturing a group of
      friends gathered in a cozy living room filled with nostalgia. One friend
      is playfully pointing to a vintage couch, while a record player spins a
      jazz tune in the background. Outside the window, hints of a historical
      celebration are visible, with American soldiers in WWII uniforms and local
      women singing joyfully. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, filled with
      memories of friendship, history, and music.

      Warm, nostalgic painterly illustration of a 1945 Plzeň living room: a
      father pulls a bottle of schnapps from a cupboard as a small jazz combo
      (trumpet, sax, upright bass) plays; American GIs in parkas have placed
      their helmets on a worn sofa with a small handmade sign "tady nesedej";
      through the open window a jeep with a white star rolls by and factory
      girls in simple 1940s dresses dance and sing in the doorway — evening,
      soft sepia tones, cozy historic details, slightly stylized.
