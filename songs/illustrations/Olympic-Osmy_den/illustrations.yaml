      Create an illustration depicting a melancholic scene of two people
      separated by a week, with a calendar showing the days passing. Include
      imagery that symbolizes longing and silence, such as a pencil lying unused
      and a clock with its hands stuck on the eighth day. The atmosphere should
      convey a sense of yearning and missed connections.
