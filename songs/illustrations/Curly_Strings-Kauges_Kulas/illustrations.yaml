      The song describes a nostalgic summer spent in a remote village at a
      grandmother's house, highlighting the simplicity and isolation of rural
      life. The narrator longs for youthful experiences, running to the beach to
      sunbathe and play, but finds the beach deserted except for an old man. The
      village lacks modern amenities and youth, creating a stark contrast to
      city life. The narrator reflects on the emptiness of the beach and the
      dirt road leading to it, but looks forward to a village party where they
      hope to meet other young people. The imagery evokes a sense of longing for
      connection and the bittersweet nature of rural solitude.
