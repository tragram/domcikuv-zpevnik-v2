      Create an ethereal landscape depicting Scarborough Fair, featuring a
      serene hill surrounded by deep forest green. Include elements like
      parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme, a sparrow tracing patterns in the
      snow, and a soldier polishing a gun nearby. Capture a sense of nostalgia
      and longing, with a backdrop of gentle leaves falling and a hint of war in
      the distance.
